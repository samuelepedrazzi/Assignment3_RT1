>This is a Gazebo and Rviz-based ROS Robotics Simulator.
The goal of this project was to build three mobility modes that the user could choose from to allow the robot to explore an unknown but constrained territory.
On a user-interface terminal window, the user can pick the robot's desired behavior; modalities include:

_1- Autonomous Drive_: The user can select a goal position for the robot, and it will reach there on its own.
_2- Free Drive_: The user can use the keyboard to drive the robot in the environment.
_3- Driver Assistant_: The operator can direct the robot's movement with its keayboard, but an obstacle avoidance algorithm will keep the robot from colliding with walls.
